## Overview

![Portfolio Screenshot](./src/components/assets/images/Portfolio.png)

This is my personal portfolio website built using React. It showcases my projects, skills, and experience to potential employers or clients. Here a link to my portfolio, [ggruenspan.ca](https://ggruenspan-portfolio.netlify.app), its currently being hosted on netlify.com.

Overall, creating this portfolio was a great learning experience for me. It allowed me to practice my React skills and gain a deeper understanding of front-end web development. I also learned how to structure a portfolio website effectively to highlight my work and provide a great user experience.

Some of the technical things that I learned or improved on during this project include:
- React components and component composition  
- Responsive design using CSS media queries
<!-- Routing and navigation using React Router -->
- Integrating third-party libraries or frameworks
